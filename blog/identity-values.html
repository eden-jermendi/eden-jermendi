        <h2 class="gradient-heading">Reflection Questions</h2>

        <h3>Ethical Decision</h3>
        <p>
          When I recently got a very negative comment on Reddit, instead of
          replying reactively I decided to correct the misinformation and fairly
          defend myself without giving the person any fuel for their anger. They
          tried to reply to me again but once again I shut their argument down
          politely, corrected the confusion in their response, and went on with
          my business. Typically I would react, engage, and get more stressed
          from a situation like this, but I decided to step away.
        </p>

        <h3>Culture and Values</h3>
        <p>
          I come from a Romanian and Hungarian background. I definitely
          (alongside trauma) inherited a strong work ethic and the habit of
          standing up for myself and what is right. Currently my second family
          and friends around me keep me humbled and in check, which allows us to
          grow together and communicate and live healthily in community.
        </p>

        <h3>Strengths Supporting Learning</h3>
        <p>
          My biggest 3 strengths are Humour, Bravery, and Love of Learning. I
          think humour will help me cope with things that don't make sense or
          that I will struggle with, but my bravery will keep me going even
          against all odds. My love of learning will sustain me on this path, as
          my curiosity combined with genuine interest in how everything works
          (likely related to ADHD/autism) keeps me moving on to the next thing
          while staying mindful and taking care of myself to prevent burnout.
        </p>

        <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <p>
          My main limitations are emotional sensitivity at times due to ongoing
          trauma healing, which can still be triggered. My assertiveness and
          tendency to take control of the narrative could also prevent me from
          gaining knowledge from others or might intimidate people
          unintentionally. My spontaneity may come across as unserious or
          scattered, but that is just part of my neurotic self. I also have
          self-esteem issues I am working on, which I know will be challenged by
          this course, but I am ready to improve on all of these limitations.
        </p>

        <h3>Working With Others</h3>
        <p>
          In my last flat there were some flatmates who would not do any of the
          weekly cleaning chores, so we tried very passive gentle nudges and
          then more expectation-style rigidity, but nothing really worked.
          Direct communication, understanding why the individual may not be able
          to perform at the time, and talking one on one has been the most
          effective way to get everyone on board. I would also probably try to
          nip the issue in the bud earlier and be more clear and direct while
          staying less intimidating, so the message comes across better.
