        <h2 class="gradient-heading">What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
        <p>
          Emotional intelligence is similar to intellectual intelligence, but
          the difference is that EQ is about managing your own emotions,
          reactions, and how your own biases can affect others and the
          interactions you have. It’s not just about what you know, but how you
          communicate that knowledge in the best way possible for yourself and
          others. It’s also about managing and navigating how others react and
          behave around you. The main pillars of EQ are
          <strong
            >self-awareness, self-regulation, empathy, social skills,</strong
          >
          and <strong>motivation</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2 class="gradient-heading">How is EQ Different to IQ?</h2>
        <p>
          EQ specifically refers to this subtle set of skills (which is why it’s
          often called a meta-skill) that is learned with intention. You’re not
          born with it automatically, and you may struggle to develop EQ if
          you’re not in an environment that encourages healthy emotional growth.
        </p>

        <h2 class="gradient-heading">Why is EQ Important?</h2>
        <p>
          EQ is the difference between someone who is just really smart, and
          someone who is really smart and knows how to control themselves,
          communicate clearly, and connect with others in a way that leaves a
          bigger impact. A person could be very experienced in their field, but
          if their competitor shows much stronger EQ, the competitor is often
          better suited for leadership or team lead roles.
