        <h2 class="gradient-heading">Learning Competencies</h2>
        <p>This blog should strengthen your understanding of:</p>
        <ul class="inside-dot">
          <li>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</li>
          <li>Control flow and loops, arrays, and objects</li>
          <li>Functions and why they are useful</li>

        <h3>
          An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS
        </h3>
        <p>
          Like in my earlier blog post where I mentioned the house analogy of
          HTML being the blueprint or plans/instructions on what to build and
          the foundations, CSS is the painter, tiler, etc well Javascript would
          be like the electronic wiring or water or gas. It adds interactivity
          or functionality to the house/your webpage and kind of brings it all
          together, because what is a home without power, gas and water?
        </p>

        <h3>
          Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday
          life
        </h3>
        <p>
          Control flow is sort of like the order of operations in math, it’s the
          process by which the webpage is reading the code. Loops are a very
          efficient way of avoiding writing the same thing repeated over and
          over again, we can just use a loop to automate it!
        </p>
        <p>
          Control flow is like making a cup of tea, the order everything is done
          has to be correct in order to brew a perfect cuppa. The control flow
          decision would be if the water is finished boiling, pour the water
          into the cup. But a loop would be, check if water is done boiling if
          not keep checking, if its done move to next step.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with
          it
        </h3>
        <p>
          The DOM which stands for Document Object Model is a fancy way of
          basically saying this is how the control flow of your HTML
          (blueprint), CSS (paint and furnishings) and JS (electrical wiring
          etc.) all work together when being seen or retrieved by the browser
          from your raw code.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can interact with it by opening Dev Tools (right click and
          inspect/inspect element) and typing JS code into the console, as well
          as use the pointer to find the exact node (basically an object that
          contains elements and other information) to target or modify.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>NOTE:</strong> Changes made in the DOM do
          <strong>NOT</strong> change the actual file, so if you want to alter
          it use the normal Git process. Playing around with the DOM is a fun
          and very helpful way of understanding how all these aspects come
          together and are interpreted and spit back out to the user via
          browser.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects
        </h3>
        <p>
          An array is like a list, it can hold string (text) or numbers but
          unlike an object you can’t store or access keys. Objects are more
          handy for when you want to store various types of information on a
          user for example so their user name is the key and within that you can
          store arrays or other data types.
        </p>
        <p>
          So accessing data from each differs as you can only really go between
          the indexes on an array whereas objects you can store way more
          information on just 1 user or key. So accessing an array is like
          reading a shopping list, item 1, item 2 and so on. Accessing an object
          is more like opening a box or a file with all sorts of information on
          it.
        </p>

        <pre><code>// Array example
let shoppingList = ['milk', 'bread', 'eggs']
console.log(shoppingList[0])   // "milk"
console.log(shoppingList[2])   // "eggs"

// Object example
let user = {
  name: 'Eden',
  age: 25,
  hobbies: ['coding', 'gaming']
}
console.log(user.name)         // "Eden"
console.log(user.hobbies[1])   // "gaming"
</code></pre>

        <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful</h3>
        <p>
          Functions are a helpful way of writing and re-using code. For example,
          instead of writing the same logic every time, you can make a function
          that checks which key the user presses. Then, based on that key, the
          function can trigger a different action or show something new on the
          screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          It also super helpful to organise your code especially with larger
          projects, and make changes in a more clear and easy to navigate
          manner.
