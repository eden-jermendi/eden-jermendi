        <h2 class="gradient-heading">Research: Neuroplasticity</h2>

        <h3>
          How understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people
        </h3>
        <p>
          The core principles of neuroplasticity include: incrementally
          increasing in difficulty, repetition spaced out over time, and most
          importantly, perspective and breaking huge goals into smaller ones day
          by day (or even within the day) to get that natural reward system
          activating even when learning more and more difficult or dense topics.
        </p>
        <p>
          These principles benefit people because despite the growing research
          on neuroplasticity most people still live, work and study in a fixed
          mindset. Growth mindset allows us to use our bodies and work with
          ourselves to become better learners, teachers, employees and
          ultimately better human beings.
        </p>

        <h3>
          How I might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for my
          benefit
        </h3>
        <p>
          I have definitely already started to apply principles like repetition
          at even intervals of concepts and deeply changing my perspective on
          learning and not being down on myself. A severely understated part of
          the benefits of learning about neuroplasticity and learning is
          <strong>being kind to yourself</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can do all of these changes as the scientists have determined but
          if you don't start to accept you deserve to learn, be seen as
          intelligent but also be vulnerable and have some humility on your
          journey of growth you ultimately won't get as far as someone less
          technically intelligent but who has developed stronger skills to work
          with their own brain and body.
        </p>

        <h3>Ways to increase neuroplasticity</h3>
        <p>
          Common ways to increase neuroplasticity are learning a new language
          (be it human or code), engaging in mentally stimulating activities
          like sudoku, puzzles, daily short quizzes and challenges. Learning new
          instruments, or engaging with any other creative pursuit is known to
          increase neuroplasticity too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Basically anything and everything new to your brain is creating new
          neural networks, but continuing to practice regularly paves the
          highway wider and wider for more consistent connections. This results
          in better recall, memory, applied knowledge and overall confidence of
          the individual. The food you eat also heavily impacts your overall and
          brain health.

        <h2 class="gradient-heading">Research: Growth Mindset</h2>

        <h3>What it is and why it is relevant</h3>
        <p>
          Growth mindset in simple terms is the belief that one’s own ability to
          learn and understand or participate in/do something is malleable,
          adaptable and is constantly changing and growing. As opposed to fixed
          mindset which is the belief that you are as you are born, at 25 your
          brain stops developing and that’s it. But we have since the past 15–20
          years come to find this is not scientifically accurate anymore.
        </p>

        <h3>Did anything surprise or change for me?</h3>
        <p>
          I didn't realise the impact positive self talk (in your head and out
          loud) can have in shifting the brain from fixed to growth mindset. I
          found this quite useful as someone who has struggled with a strong
          inner critic for decades.
        </p>

        <h3>How I will integrate growth mindset into my learning journey</h3>
        <p>
          Focus way more on eating better and exercising even a little bit
          daily, keep noting down and repeating concepts I don't fully grasp a
          day or two later to build stronger pathways, make sure I am in the
          discomfort-learning area not just in comfort (push myself when I can
          but not over do it).
        </p>
        <p>
          And to prevent burnout take regular breaks and even if I have a day of
          code, play a game that uses my logic brain to keep it engaged in a fun
          way.
        </p>

        <h2 class="gradient-heading">Blending With My Learning Plan</h2>
        <p>
          Looking back at my learning plan and comparing it to what I have just
          touched on, the main things that really stand out to me are to
          continue working on my positive self talk and not be my own biggest
          critic every second of the day.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also need to make sure I am mentally and physically fit so my brain
          doesn't have to struggle with new concepts. And lastly, as we are now
          at Sprint 4, I am going to start noting down things that challenge me
          so I can review the concept the next day to better pave those neural
          pathways.
