        <h3>Sept 2025</h3>

        <h2 class="gradient-heading">Pseudocode</h2>
        <p>
          I feel confident in breaking down problems and turning them into
          pseudocode. I have been doing that for most of the JavaScript Kata in
          Sprint 4 and found it super useful overall. Where I am feeling
          challenged currently is actually starting to write the code and where
          to begin.
        </p>

        <pre><code>// Example of how I start
// 1. Break problem into steps
// 2. Write each step in plain English
// 3. Translate step-by-step into code
</code></pre>

        <h2 class="gradient-heading">Trying Something</h2>
        <p>
          I am reasonably confident with trying something, looking at
          <code>npm test</code> or console logs, and debugging from there.
          Although I feel it's going to take more time until I feel more
          confident in what I try and what outcome I expect from trying it.
        </p>

        <h2 class="gradient-heading">Rubber Ducky Method</h2>
        <p>
          Talking aloud as I study, especially after having broken down the
          problem, has been reasonably helpful and I feel quite confident in
          doing this.
        </p>

        <h2 class="gradient-heading">Reading Error Messages</h2>
        <p>
          While it was difficult at the beginning to interpret error messages
          and what to do with them, I am starting to feel way more confident
          about reading them and trying something - or Googling/asking ChatGPT
          for help with deciphering them, to find out what the issue is.
        </p>

        <h2 class="gradient-heading">Console.logging</h2>
        <p>
          I haven't been doing this much but had a great chat with Facilitator
          David who helped me figure out the best ways of using
          <code>console.log</code> to better visualise each step of my code and
          connect the abstract to the code itself. So my confidence is
          definitely higher now with console logging.
        </p>

        <pre><code>console.log("Step 1:", myVariable)
console.log("After loop:", array)
</code></pre>

        <h2 class="gradient-heading">Googling</h2>
        <p>
          I use W3Schools and MDN mainly for reference, but ultimately I have
          been using ChatGPT-prompting it deliberately to help nudge me, reword
          the question, or explain the why and how, not just provide the answer
          straight away. I feel pretty confident with this process, especially
          after running it through David (Facilitator) and getting his
          reassurance about my process.
        </p>

        <h2 class="gradient-heading">Asking Your Peers for Help</h2>
        <p>
          I don't feel confident doing this yet as I feel I cannot help anyone
          at this point, so how could someone help me? I also don't want to be a
          bother to them, definitely something I will work on actively.
        </p>

        <h2 class="gradient-heading">Asking Coaches for Help</h2>
        <p>
          I feel very confident when I have tried all avenues before bringing an
          issue forward. I feel confident with this because I have had feedback
          that my questions are formatted in an easy-to-understand way that
          makes the coaches/facilitators' job easier when helping me.
        </p>

        <h2 class="gradient-heading">Improving Your Process With Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          Reflection has been an interesting one. I am definitely feeling more
          confident with doing reflections, but I feel I am yet to fully bear
          the fruits of my labour. I do find it helpful just to offload anything
          mentally and gather my thoughts at the end of something. My confidence
          is definitely building slowly with self-reflection.
